            <p>1:42 PM: Ok so I started programmig this versio of the website 3 days ago ad have fially gotte aroud to addig a blog(ish) feature. I was workig o this durig the sciobwl scrimmage so it does\'t look too great yet. I thik I might wat to reame it tho, I\'m boucig aroud a few differet ames.</p>\

            <p>2:57 PM: I took a break but I\'m back at it. I brew istalled "tree" which made the directory thig way easier. I still eed to write some script to auto-update it though so that I do\'t hae to copy-ad-paste every time I update the site...</p>\
            <p>3:10 PM: Ok gl it sucks to ot be able to use this letter. I have to paste it i everywhere. Ca I chage my keybids easily???</p>\
            <p>3:39 PM: ote to self - make that chicke thi agai with the lemo</p>\
            <p>3:40 PM: Moved this over to the mai project, so ow it fits the theme. Also, future Lukas is supposed to make post titles clickable so that they ca ope as solo posts i a ew widow. If thats the case, ice jo future Lukas.</p>\
            <p>4:09 PM: nnnnnnnnnnn I attached a keyboard to my laptop so I can use n\'s again!</p>\
            <p>6:15 PM: Hey so it\'s the next day lol. I dwas pretty lazy today so all I\'ve done is scan some images for my gallery. Also might make a little shop for prints in the unlikely case that anyone might want to buy one. Just set up my laptop so that it connects to my monitor and added an external keyboard and wireless mouse. This solution is working fine for now, but I can\'t use mac shortcuts on my pc\'s keyboard which kinda sucks :/</p>\
            <p>6:18 PM: Gonna take a shot at converting a Java tba that I made a while ago into JavaScript so that it might run on the website? Not sure how well that will go because JS isn\'t my best friend.</p>\
            <p>1:46 PM: Internet is down, so this is the perfect time to get back to work, unfortunately my keyoard is not working great.</p>\
